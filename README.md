# Unsupervised_ML

TASK 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML

From the given "Iris" dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Unsupervised ML is a type of ML that looks for previously undetected patterns in a dataset with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human spervision. In contrast to supervised ML that usually makes use of human - labelled data, unspervised ML, also known as self organisation allows for modelling of probability densities over inputs.
